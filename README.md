Welcome to my Portfolio.
========================

this webpage is complete with a simple header, main, and footer.

Header
------

on the header is a title and navigation bar that breaks down into a navigation
menu. On the menu are three destinations which are the three sections of the
page: About Me, Contact Me, and My Work

Main
----

# about me section #

The main section includes a picture of me and my girlfriend. To the right of that are three large texts serving as an introduction to me. Underneath is a break and a paragraph describing my beginning journey into coding. At the end of the paragraph is a link to my resume.

# contact me section #

The contact me section is a small bar cutting across the screen with interactive buttons displaying the logos of the different ways to contact me.

# my work section #

this section contains several placeholder images that will remind you they're placeholders when you click on them. the only link that works is my first project that i just finished yesterday(rock paper scissors).

footer
------

the footer only has a brief message thanking the user for visiting the page.
